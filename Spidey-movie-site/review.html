            <h2>REVIEW</h2>

            <p><strong>Matthew Marold</strong></p>

            <p>
                <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> is a cinematic event that pays tribute to over two decades of Spider-Man films. As a fan, watching Tom Holland team up with previous Spider-Men was nothing short of magical. The emotional stakes were real, the villains were powerful, and the fan service hit every note just right.

                What makes this film stand out is not just the multiverse chaos, but its heart. The character development of Peter Parker is deeply moving, especially as he faces the consequences of being a hero. It's one of the best entries in the MCU and an unforgettable ride from start to finish.
